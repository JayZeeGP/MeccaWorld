{ Test file number 03
We will show how to use conditional schemes }

#Variables can be declared outside the modes
number jordan:=23;
number magic:=32;
number bird:=33;

if jordan > magic then
	string print:=jordan+" is bigger than "+magic;
else
	string print:=jordan+" is not bigger than "+magic;
end_if;

write(print);

if jordan < magic then
	if jordan < bird then
		string print2:=jordan+" is smaller than "+magic+" and "+bird;
	end_if;
end_if;

write(print2);

#You can also do it like this

if jordan < magic and jordan < bird then
	print2:=jordan+" is smaller than "+magic+" and "+bird + " second way ";
end_if;

write(print2);
